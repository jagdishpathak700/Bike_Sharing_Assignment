## General Information
BoomBikes, a US bike-sharing company, seeks to recover from pandemic-related revenue losses by understanding post-lockdown bike demand. 
They aim to identify key factors influencing demand in the American market to optimize their business strategy and capitalize on future growth. 
They are using a dataset of daily bike rentals and associated variables to build a predictive model.

## Conclusions
- It indicates that Year 2019 has a significantly higher bike rental demand than Year 2018. This supports the idea that bike-sharing is gaining popularity.
- Holidays tend to have a lower bike rental demand. This might be because people are less likely to commute or more likely to travel by other means.
- Spring has a lower bike rental demand compared to the base season (which is likely fall, as it's not explicitly listed). Winter has a slightly higher demand than spring,
  but still lower than the base season (fall). It is important to note that this is still lower than the average, as spring was significantly negative. This is somewhat counter intuitive,
  but can be explained by the fact that the base season is likely fall.
- Light snow or rain significantly reduces bike rental demand and mist or cloudy weather also reduces bike rental demand, but not as severely as light snow/rain.
- September has a higher bike rental demand compared to the base month. This aligns with the understanding that fall months are popular for biking.
